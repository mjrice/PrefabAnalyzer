# PrefabAnalyzer
The purpose of this little app is to analyze the playability of a randomly generated world in the game 7 Days to Die by looking at the variety and distribution of buildings ("prefabs") in the output files generated by the game.   It is written in C# and the project workspace is set up for Visual Studio Code.  The program runs as a console app that you edit beforehand with the name of the world you want to anayze.  There is no UI!

# Sample output

There were 1362 prefab instances of 336 types found in the world "Navezgane" which was created on Tuesday, December 18, 2018 at 12:31 AM
Prefabs will spawn between coordinates (-2298,5,-2420) and (2408,147,2291)
In a grid with each block 470.7 by 471.2 meters, here is the number of prefabs in each block:
	0	0	0	0	3	2	2	1	3	1	
	3	6	6	14	15	5	22	16	130	6	
	0	8	11	16	7	10	16	11	12	0

	2	44	5	22	21	13	17	14	17	0	
	0	9	2	10	1	3	7	0	4	2	

The 10 most commonly duplicated prefabs account for 11.23% of the prefabs and are:
